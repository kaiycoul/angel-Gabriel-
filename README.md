Angel Gabriel 
Archangel most seen as both Male and Female due to the roles this Archangel has and the physical appearance often given as soft features, gentleness and feminine characteristics in modern age. I will refer to the masculine side however I do see both sides of this beautiful Angel when he appears and gives his messages. Gabriel is also known as the Christmas Angel due to giving the message of Christs birth and it gave rise to acknowledging him as a messenger of God.


In actual fact his name means 'Strong like God' or 'God is my Strength'. Showing his importance as a communicator and powerful connections to the divine within us. Offering to bring us faith and strength in our connection to the divine creator, God or the One.

~ Symbols of Archangel Gabriel...He is often seen with peace lilies, trumpet, harp or scrolls. He has many musical connections and images due to this being a mode of communication and music evoking emotions, feelings and memories. Gabriel uses music to pass on messages from spirit, when we meditate to connect with our spiritual self and through dreams to offer guidance.The peace lilies are a sign of peace being offered to you, in a way of saying all will be well. Lastly scrolls offer higher wisdom and knowledge within. He comes to give you information relevant to your future but also so that you may understand your past, your purpose and role in this lifetime.
~ Roles of Archangel Gabriel...This amazing Archangel is a channel, a communicator and messenger of the highest order. Gabriel will work to send your prayers to Heaven and spirit loved ones, as well as relaying messages back to you. He works with peace, patience and calm to ensure that communication is clear and precise. Gabriel also works with time management and allowing extra time to complete important tasks. If you are running short on time for a deadline and need a little help call on Gabriel to assist.

Lastly he was given the role of watching over children from new babies to teenagers! From their first cry a baby communicates a feeling and need, Gabriel sets to work. To ensure they develop their skills and to assist parents and guardians to understand their level of communication. Archangel Gabriel works on many levels here so that we can become conscious spiritual being connected with energy communication. This is deeper and more intuitive than our physical voice. Being God's strength means that he can instill within us the 'Never give up' mindset and show us how to ask for help when we need it!

~ Colour Associated with Archangel Gabriel...There are two main colours, one being white and the second shades of yellow through to gold. White brings clarity, clear communication and understanding. Whereas the golds have higher information, uplifting spiritual energy and ascension. Both are uplifting with Gabriels energy being very much about raising vibrations and sparking understanding of our inner wisdom.



~ Crystals Associated with Archangel Gabriel...The main crystal is Amber however there are also connections with Citrine, Carnelian and Clear Quartz. All these beautiful crystals will heighten intuition and clear away any limiting beliefs that stop you from believing in yourself. I particularly like clear quartz as it's intention can be altered and adapted depending on what we need help with. Gabriel assists us to see problems differently and find alternative ways to communicate so this works well for me. However you may prefer to start with a crystal in Gabriels colour energy field to build up your relationship first.

Carnelian is particularly good for motivation, positive life choices, energy and courage. It brings through Gabriels fun side and pushing you to keep going. If you are lacking in energy then this is a go to crystal. If you are also looking to spark ideas and get communication going through a group of people then carnelian placed in a work space or busy part of the home also works very well. Gabriels energy will infuse into the situation and people concerned to create harmony and a sense of pulling together
